## Project description

In the class, we have introduced a bunch of edge-aware filtering: bilateral,
WLS, Local extrema, Diffusion map, Domain transform, Local Laplacian, L0
minimization and Guided filter. In this assignment, you have three options. For
the first option, you have to implement one of Local extrema or Diffusion map
(which do not have their source codes released). You are free to use any
language of your choice. For the second option, you can implement one of the
following filters, bilateral, WLS, Guided filter, Domain transform, local
Laplacian and L0 minimization (which have made their matlab codes publically
available) with a language other than matlab. In the third option, you are
asked to compare at least three of the following filters, bilateral, WLS,
Guided filter, Domain transform, local Laplacian and L0 minimization (which
have made their code publically available). Note that, since these options have
different levels of difficulty, option #1 has the highest baseline grade,
followed by option #2 and option #3 has the lowest. You are asked to use detail
manipulation as the example to illustrate your filter or to compare filters.
Other applications will be counted as bonus.
